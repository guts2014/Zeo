List of TODO List

## What Is This?

This my personal project to learn Backbone, RequireJS, and Twitter Bootstrap.

The code is based from Addy Osmani's [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/), the one with 
Backbone.JS + RequireJS. I modify it to work with Twitter Bootstrap so it works on desktop and mobile.

## Demo

For demo, checkout this [link](http://abiyasa.github.com/todotodo-bootstrap/).

Just like the original, the TODO list is stored locally using localStorage.
